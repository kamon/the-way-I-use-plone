The way I use Plone
===================

The way I use Plone, or my Plone projects practices.

## Guiding principles and prerequisites

* More a philosophical principle that we should follow in all we do, but I do not expect all my use cases to have a Plone-based answer. (I've seen that too often in both projects' specification and implementation phases, and it makes us loose valuable time. Time to stop!)
* Ideally, I use a setup with Plone 4.3+ where the default content types are replaced with the Dexterity-based ones (plone.app.contenttypes).
* I use browser views instead of TTW templates and scripts whenever possible.
